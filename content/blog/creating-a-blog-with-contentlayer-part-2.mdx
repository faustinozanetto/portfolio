# üåü Introduction

In this blog post, we're picking up where we left off with our blog project using [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev) in the previous post. If you haven't had a chance to read part 1 yet, you can catch up by clicking [here](https://www.faustinozanetto.com/blog/creating-a-blog-with-contentlayer-part-1). This time around, our focus will be on introducing exciting new features like **code highlighting**, fine-tuning our **styling**, and diving into more **advanced** topics. Let's continue the journey! üòÉüöÄ

## üìö Prerequisites

Before we dive into the exciting developments in this part, I strongly recommend that you take a moment to ensure you've read and completed the walkthrough of part 1 in this tutorial. However, if you'd prefer to skip the previous part and get right into the action, you can conveniently clone the repository for part 1 directly from [here](https://github.com/faustinozanetto/nextjs-contentlayer-blog). It's your choice! üìñüîóüöÄ

## üì¶ Adding dependencies to our application

While we've successfully set up our basic dependencies for the blog, including the essential [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev), to unlock the new features we're about to work on, it's crucial to install the following dependencies:

- Installing **Shiki**

  To enable syntax highlighting, let's start by installing Shiki:

  ```bash
  pnpm install shiki
  ```

  > [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io) is a javascript library for managing Syntax Highlighting.

- Installing **Rehype Pretty Code**

  To ensure beautiful code blocks in your Markdown or MDX files, we'll need rehype-pretty-code. Install it with:

  ```bash
  pnpm install rehype-pretty-code
  ```

  > [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app) is a Rehype plugin powered by the Shiki syntax highlighter that provides beautiful code blocks for Markdown or MDX.

- Installing **TailwindCSS Typography**

  Lastly, for enhanced styling on HTML elements that you don't have direct control over, we'll integrate TailwindCSS Typography. Incorporate it into your project with the following command:

  ```bash
  pnpm install --D @tailwindcss/typography
  ```

  > [TailwindCSS Typography] is a TailwindCSS plugin that adds styling to html that you don't control.

By adding these dependencies, you're equipping your blog project with a powerful set of tools to take your content presentation to the next level. üöÄüì¶‚ú®

## ‚öôÔ∏è Updating TailwindCSS Configuration

Now that you've successfully installed the mentioned dependencies, the next step is to ensure that your **TailwindCSS** configuration includes support for the **Typography** plugin. Follow these steps to make the necessary adjustments in your `tailwind.config.js` file, located in the root folder of your project:

1. Open your `tailwind.config.js` file.

2. Add the following lines to the configuration:

```js title="TailwindCSS Updated Configuration" showLineNumbers {5}
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
  // ... (other configuration options)
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")], // Add this line
};
export default config;
```

By including `require('@tailwindcss/typography')` in the plugins array, you enable the **Typography** plugin within your **TailwindCSS** setup. This will allow you to apply consistent and appealing styles to various HTML elements in your project, enhancing the visual presentation of your blog content. üé®üí°‚ú®

## üìÑ Modifying our Content Schema

To enable support for new features like code highlighting, follow these steps to make changes to your `contentlayer.config.ts` file, which is located in the root folder of your project:

```ts title="Updated Contentlayer Configuration" showLineNumbers {5,6}
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files';

export const BlogPost = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  filePathPattern: `**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: 'mdx',
  ...restOfConfig,
}));
```

As observed, we've made two key modifications in this section. Firstly, we've updated the **filePathPattern** from **.md** to **.mdx**. This adjustment signifies a shift to using MDX files for our blog content. Secondly, we've introduced a new property, **contentType**, and set it to **'mdx'**. This addition is crucial for informing **Contentlayer** that we are now working with **MDX** files as our content source.

## üñãÔ∏è Updating our Posts Files

Following the extension type update in the previous section, we need to reflect these changes in our blog post files as well. To accomplish this, navigate to your **content** folder, which resides in the root directory of your project, and ensure that you modify the file extensions from **'.md'** to **'.mdx'**. This alignment ensures consistency and compatibility with the new MDX format.

Next we will create a new blog post to test out the new features we will be building in this part. To do so, create a new file in your **content** folder called `another-post.mdx` and paste the following code:

````mdx

# Testing a Code Block

Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Vero ipsam voluptatibus nihil laborum qui quia fuga voluptate autem sequi, nostrum dicta officiis culpa cum officia reprehenderit porro veritatis eligendi, at suscipit nemo voluptas ipsa sunt in voluptatem. Nostrum, id tempore, quaerat animi officia recusandae consequuntur impedit nulla, deserunt neque reiciendis!

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Testing Code Block"
import { allPosts } from '@contentlayer/generated';
import BlogPost from 'components/blog-post';
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

type PostPageProps = {
  params: {
    slug: string;
  };
};

export async function generateStaticParams(): Promise<PostPageProps['params'][]> {
  return allPosts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.url,
  }));
}

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: PostPageProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  const post = allPosts.find((post) => post._raw.flattenedPath === params.slug);

  if (!post) throw new Error(`Could not find post for slug: ${params.slug}`);

  const { title, description } = post;

  return {
    title,
    description,
  };
}

export default async function PostPage(props: PostPageProps) {
  const { params } = props;

  const post = allPosts.find((post) => post._raw.flattenedPath === params.slug);

  if (!post) notFound();

  return <BlogPost post={post} />;
}
```
````

This blog post contains a sample code block so that we can test the syntax highlighting we will be building in the following steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating a new Blog Post Component

It's time to streamline our blog post rendering by relocating it from the **blog post page** to its **dedicated component**. To achieve this, we will create a new file named `blog-post.tsx` within the `src/components` folder. This architectural adjustment enhances the organization and maintainability of our project.

```bash
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  src
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ post-card.tsx
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blog-post.tsx
```

Once you've created the `blog-post.tsx` file, proceed to copy and paste the following code into it. This code defines the structure and behavior of our blog post component, enabling us to efficiently render and present our blog posts in a clean and modular way.

```tsx title="Blog Post Component" showLineNumbers {6, 8-10, 19, 37}
'use client';

import React from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';
import { Post as PostData } from '@contentlayer/generated';
import { useMDXComponent } from 'next-contentlayer/hooks';

const components = {
  Image,
};

type BlogPostProps = {
  post: PostData;
};

const BlogPost: React.FC<BlogPostProps> = (props) => {
  const { post } = props;

  const MDXComponent = useMDXComponent(post.body.code);

  return (
    <article className="prose dark:prose-invert container py-10 mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4">
      <div className="mb-8">
        <Image
          className="w-full bg-no-repeat object-cover mb-2 h-80"
          src={post.image}
          alt={`${post.title} Image`}
          width={500}
          height={500}
        />
        <h1 className="mb-1 text-xl font-semibold leading-snug tracking-tight">{post.title}</h1>
        <time dateTime={post.publishDate} className="mb-2 text-sm">
          {new Date(post.publishDate).toDateString()}
        </time>
        <p className="mt-1.5">{post.description}</p>
      </div>
      <MDXComponent components={components} />
    </article>
  );
};

export default BlogPost;
```

Lets break down whats going on in this component:

1. **Import Statements**: In this section, we import necessary modules, such as **React**, **Image** from Next.js, the Post type from **Contentlayer**, and the **useMDXComponent** hook from next-contentlayer/hooks.

2. **Components Object**: We define a **components** object, which is used to pass custom components to the **MDXComponent**. Currently, we've added the **Image** component from Next.js, but you can include more custom components here as **needed**.

3. **MDX Hook Component**: The **useMDXComponent** hook is essential for rendering the blog post content. It takes the `post.body.code` and returns a `JSX` component that can be used to render the **Markdown** content.

4. **Return Section**: This section returns the rendered blog post within an **article** element. The component uses CSS classes provided by the `tailwindcss/typography` plugin for styling. Additionally, it replaces the old div tag with the new **MDXComponent** to render the content.

```tsx
<div className="[&>*]:mb-3 [&>*:last-child]:mb-0" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.body.html }} /> // old tag
<MDXComponent components={components} /> // new tag
```

This **BlogPost** component makes it easier to manage and display your blog post content, and it also allows for the integration of custom components for a more dynamic presentation.

## üß© Updating Blog Post Page

Now that we created the new blog post component, we need to update the blog post page to fit this change. To do so, locate your `page.tsx` under the `src/pages/posts/[slug]` folder. Aftewards copy the following code:

```tsx title="Updated Blog Post Page" showLineNumbers {2, 38}
import { allPosts } from '@contentlayer/generated';
import BlogPost from 'components/blog-post';
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

type PostPageProps = {
  params: {
    slug: string;
  };
};

export async function generateStaticParams(): Promise<PostPageProps['params'][]> {
  return allPosts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.url,
  }));
}

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: PostPageProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  const post = allPosts.find((post) => post._raw.flattenedPath === params.slug);

  if (!post) throw new Error(`Could not find post for slug: ${params.slug}`);

  const { title, description } = post;

  return {
    title,
    description,
  };
}

export default async function PostPage(props: PostPageProps) {
  const { params } = props;

  const post = allPosts.find((post) => post._raw.flattenedPath === params.slug);

  if (!post) notFound();

  return <BlogPost post={post} />;
}
```

As you can see, there are only a few changes from the old page. First, we imported our newly created component `<BlogPost/>` from the components folder as shown. Then we replaced all the return section of the `PostPage` function by just calling our component and passing **post** as props.

This updated code makes the blog post page more organized and efficient. It separates the **rendering logic** into a separate component for better **maintainability**.

## Adding Code Highlighting

We've now reached a crucial part of our tutorial ‚Äì adding support for code highlighting in your blog project. To enable this feature, you'll need to make some adjustments to your `contentlayer.config.ts` file, which is located in the root folder of your project. Follow these steps to implement code highlighting:

```ts title="Update Contentlayer Configuration" {1, 5-8, 13-15}
import rehypePrettyCode from 'rehype-pretty-code';

// rest of file

/** @type {import('rehype-pretty-code').Options} */
const rehypePrettyCodeOptions = {
  theme: 'min-dark',
};

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: 'content',
  documentTypes: [BlogPost],
  mdx: {
    rehypePlugins: [[rehypePrettyCode, rehypePrettyCodeOptions]],
  },
});
```

Lets break down what we've just modified here:

1. **Import the Required Module**:
   To start, we need to import the `rehypePrettyCode` module, which allows us to use the code highlighting plugin in our project.

2. **Code Options Configuration**:
   The `rehypePrettyCode` module provides various options for configuring the code highlighting. In our case, we've updated the `theme` property to use the 'min-dark' theme. You can explore and choose from different available themes; check out [Shiki themes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md) for more options.

3. **Update the `makeSource` Function**:
   We've made a slight modification to the `makeSource` function. Specifically, we've added an `mdx` property within the function configuration. Inside the `mdx` property, we've included a `rehypePlugins` array, which contains our new `rehypePrettyCode` plugin along with its configuration.

This improved explanation provides a clearer and more structured guide to adding code highlighting to your blog project. It explains the purpose of each step and provides additional information on theme options for **code highlighting**.

## Updating Blog Styles

Now that we've successfully integrated the rehype plugins for code highlighting, let's enhance the visual appeal of our blog post content with some additional styles. To do this, navigate to the `styles.css` file under the **app** directory in your project. Copy and paste the following CSS code to apply the styles:

```css showLineNumbers title="Blog Styles"
/* Code block styles */
[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] {
  overflow: hidden;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  margin-top: 0.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

/* Code block code tag styles */
[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] code {
  display: grid;
  min-width: 100%;
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  overflow-x: auto;
  border: none;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  line-height: 1.5rem;
  counter-reset: line;
}

/* Code block pre tag styles */
[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] pre {
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  line-height: 1.5rem;
}

/* Code block title styles */
[data-rehype-pretty-code-title] {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  background-color: rgb(31, 31, 31);
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  padding-left: 0.75rem;
  padding-right: 0.75rem;
  padding-top: 0.5rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

/* Code block line numbers styles. */
[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] [data-line] {
  padding-right: 0.5rem;
}

[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] [data-line]::before {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  counter-increment: line;
  content: counter(line);
  display: inline-block;
  width: 1rem;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  text-align: right;
}
```

Here's a breakdown of each section:

- **Code Block Container (`[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment]`)**: Defines overall styles for the container of code blocks, including overflow, border-radius, and margin.

- **Code Tag Styling (`[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] code`)**: Enhances the appearance of code content with a responsive grid layout, preventing overflow, and adjusting typography for readability.

- **Pre Tag Styling (`[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] pre`)**: Styles for the pre tag within code blocks, ensuring consistent appearance and readability.

- **Code Title Bar Styling (`[data-rehype-pretty-code-title]`)**: Styles for the title bar of code blocks, providing a distinctive look with color, background, font size, and padding.

- **Line Numbers Styling (`[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] [data-line]`)**: Adds spacing and styles to line numbers for better separation and readability.

In summary, these styles collectively contribute to a visually appealing and organized presentation of code blocks in your blog content. They improve readability, prevent overflow, and create a distinctive appearance for code snippets. Feel free to customize these styles to match your design preferences.

Next, navigate to the page to preview the changes. If you've followed the steps correctly, you should be greeted with something that resembles the following:

<Image
  src="/assets/images/blog/creating-a-blog-with-contentlayer-part-2/code-block-result.webp"
  width="1920"
  height="1080"
  alt="Code Block Result"
  className="mt-2 rounded-md border shadow-lg"
/>

As evident, the previously applied styles are now visible in both the line numbers and the title section.
